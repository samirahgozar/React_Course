a state less component
also called presentational or dumb component
because it doesn't have any internal state
it's just there to output some data.


And in most react applications,
you will have more presentational and dumb components
than smart or stateful components.

when parent component controls the a child component , parent component is a controller component(smart or stateful components)
and child component is a controlled component(state less component or  presentational or dumb component)
